        <p>Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish featuring vinegared rice combined with various ingredients, most commonly seafood (both raw and cooked), vegetables, or egg, and often served cold. Reviewers often describe it as fresh, with a tangy flavor from the seasoned rice balanced by the taste of the other ingredients, which can range from mild to rich depending on the components. The overall experience is sometimes described as a delightful combination of textures and balanced flavors that can be both simple and complex.
